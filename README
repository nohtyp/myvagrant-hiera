This readme informs the user how to run this vagrant setup.  To provision boxes concurrently you would want to run the 'bootvms.sh' script.
This script will install the vm's and configure them concurrently.

The above assumes that you have the following installed:

Oracle's Virtualbox
Vagrant

If you do not want to run the servers concurrently then you can cd into the syseng_cicd directory and run the following: vagrant up and watch the servers
boot up.
